# RTMPose Basic Execution

This tutorial guides you through the basic execution of the RTMPose model on the RevyOS system. RTMPose is a high-performance human pose estimation model.

:::info[Initial Environment Setup]
Before proceeding, please ensure you have completed the [environment setup](../../env) section.
:::

## Environment Preparation

### Creating a Virtual Environment


It is recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies. You can use either `venv` or `conda` to create a virtual environment.


```shell-session
$ mkdir rtmpose && cd rtmpose
$ python3 -m venv rtmpose
$ source rtmpose/bin/activate
```

### Installing Dependencies


Download the SHL backend (execution providers), allowing onnxruntime to utilize SHL's high-performance optimization for C-SKY CPUs.


```shell-session
$ git clone -b python3.11 https://github.com/zhangwm-pt/prebuilt_whl.git
$ cd prebuilt_whl
$ pip3 install opencv_python-4.5.4+4cd224d-cp311-cp311-linux_riscv64.whl loguru onnx
```

## Obtaining Example Code

The example code for this tutorial is available on [Github](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpose). Clone it locally using the following commands:

```shell-session
$ git clone https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpose.git
$ cd mmpose/projects/rtmpose/examples/onnxruntime
```

## Obtaining the Model

The model used in this tutorial is available from the [Github repository](https://github.com/zhangwm-pt/mmpose/releases/download/rtmpose-onnx/rtmpose.onnx). Download the RTMPose model using the following command:

```shell-session
$ wget https://github.com/zhangwm-pt/mmpose/releases/download/rtmpose-onnx/rtmpose.onnx
```

### Running the Program

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

>>>>>>> a1ba329 (Added new npu files to the docs)
Navigate to the ONNX example directory in the source code and run main.py for model inference:

```shell-session
$ python3 main.py rtmpose.onnx human-pose.jpeg
``` 

:::info[Parameter Description]
- rtmpose.onnx: The pre-downloaded model file
- human-pose.jpeg: The sample image provided in the example
:::

Upon successful execution, you will see the output image `output.jpg`.
