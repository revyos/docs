# Basic Environment Setup

This section describes how to **set up an x86 computer and a LicheePi development board** to prepare for running models on the NPU or CPU of the board.

:::info[Why is an x86 machine required?]

To run models on the development board, it is first necessary to use the hhb tool on an x86 machine to convert general models such as ONNX into computation graphs and glue code executable by the board's CPU/NPU. The glue code and related application code must then be cross-compiled into binaries that can run on the board.

Since x86 machines generally offer higher performance and the hhb tool only supports the x86 architecture, an additional x86 computer is required for model conversion.
:::

## Development Board Setup

Lichee Pi 4A is a development board launched by Sipeed based on the TH1520 chip. For basic out-of-the-box configuration, refer to the [official hardware documentation](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/2_unbox.html). The recommended operating system is [RevyOS version 20250729](https://fast-mirror.isrc.ac.cn/revyos/extra/images/lpi4a/20250729/). For instructions on flashing RevyOS, see the [installation guide](../../../Installation/intro).

### Installing Basic Tools

RevyOS does not include `pip` and other basic tools by default. Install them as follows:

```shell-session
debian@revyos-lpi4a:~$ sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv wget curl git # Install required packages
debian@revyos-lpi4a:~$ mkdir npu # Create a Python virtual environment
debian@revyos-lpi4a:~$ cd npu
debian@revyos-lpi4a:~/npu$ python3 -m venv .venv
debian@revyos-lpi4a:~/npu$ . .venv/bin/activate # Activate the virtual environment
(.venv) debian@revyos-lpi4a:~/npu$ # Now inside the virtual environment
```

If the installation and activation are successful, the command prompt should be prefixed with `(.venv)`, indicating the active virtual environment.

:::info[Why use a virtual environment?]
Unlike the [original Yuque documentation](https://www.yuque.com/za4k4z/yp3bry/tx9hcuw35s9x24po#Cv3Tw), this guide adds a section on creating a virtual environment. In the original, packages such as `shl-python` are installed system-wide, which may conflict with system Python packages managed by `apt` (e.g., `python3-*`). Using a virtual environment isolates packages installed via `pip` and prevents conflicts with `apt`. For details, see [PEP 668](https://peps.python.org/pep-0668/).

### Installing the SHL Library

:::note[About SHL]

SHL (Structure of Heterogeneous Library) is a high-performance heterogeneous computing library provided by T-Head. Its main function interfaces use the CSI-NN2 API for the C-SKY CPU platform and provide a series of optimized binary libraries. [User Manual](https://www.xrvm.cn/document?temp=standard&slug=shl-user-manual)
:::

Install the SHL library using `pip` within the virtual environment:

:::caution[Version Compatibility]
The `shl-python` package is updated frequently, and the latest version may not be compatible with all boards or example code.  
**It is important to install a version of `shl-python` that matches your board and the examples you are following.**  
For example, for the LPI4A board, version `2.6.17` is known to be compatible with most provided examples.  
Check your board documentation or example requirements for the recommended version.
:::

To install a specific compatible version (e.g., `2.6.17`):

:::note[Setting a PyPI Mirror]
The default PyPI server is located overseas, which may cause network issues in mainland China. Use the `-i` option to specify a temporary PyPI mirror. For more information, refer to [Tsinghua University PyPI Mirror Usage Guide](https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/help/pypi/)
:::

After installation, use the SHL module's `--whereis` command to check the installation path.

<Tabs
  groupId='npu-version'
  defaultValue="npu"
  values={[
    {label: 'NPU', value: 'npu'},
    {label: 'CPU Only', value: 'cpu'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="npu">
```shell-session {2}
(.venv) debian@revyos-lpi4a:~/npu$ python3 -m shl --whereis th1520
/home/debian/npu/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/shl/install_nn2/th1520
```
</TabItem>
    <TabItem value="cpu">
```shell-session {2}
(.venv) debian@revyos-lpi4a:~/npu$ python3 -m shl --whereis c920
/home/debian/npu/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/shl/install_nn2/c920
```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Based on the output path (as highlighted above), set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable to specify the dynamic library search path. For example:

<Tabs
  groupId='npu-version'
  defaultValue="npu"
  values={[
    {label: 'NPU', value: 'npu'},
    {label: 'CPU Only', value: 'cpu'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="npu">
```shell-session
$ export SHL_PATH=/home/debian/npu/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/shl/install_nn2/th1520/lib # Use the path from above
```
</TabItem>
    <TabItem value="cpu">
```shell-session
$ export SHL_PATH=/home/debian/npu/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/shl/install_nn2/c920/lib # Use the path from above
```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Add it to the environment variables:

```shell-session
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$SHL_PATH:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

To make this setting persistent, add the above `export` command to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile`.

### Installing HHB-onnxruntime

HHB-onnxruntime integrates the SHL backend (execution providers), enabling onnxruntime to utilize SHL's high-performance code optimized for C-SKY CPUs.

<Tabs
  groupId='npu-version'
  defaultValue="npu"
  values={[
    {label: 'NPU', value: 'npu'},
    {label: 'CPU Only', value: 'cpu'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="npu">
```shell-session
$ wget https://github.com/zhangwm-pt/prebuilt_whl/raw/refs/heads/python3.11/numpy-1.25.0-cp311-cp311-linux_riscv64.whl
$ wget https://github.com/zhangwm-pt/onnxruntime/releases/download/riscv_whl_v2.6.0/hhb_onnxruntime_th1520-2.6.0-cp311-cp311-linux_riscv64.whl
$ pip install numpy-1.25.0-cp311-cp311-linux_riscv64.whl hhb_onnxruntime_th1520-2.6.0-cp311-cp311-linux_riscv64.whl
```
</TabItem>
    <TabItem value="cpu">
```shell-session

```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note[About Github Network Proxy]
If you experience network issues accessing GitHub from mainland China, consider using a network proxy tool to accelerate access.
:::

### NPU Driver Configuration

Compared to CPU execution, NPU inference requires the NPU driver module `vha` to be loaded. Use `lsmod` to list loaded drivers:

```shell-session {2-3}
$ lsmod | grep vha
vha                   970752  0
img_mem               827392  1 vha
```

If the `vha` module (highlighted above) is not listed, load it manually:

```shell-session
$ sudo modprobe vha vha_info img_mem
```

:::info[User-space NPU Driver Configuration]
In addition to the kernel driver, user-space drivers are also required for NPU execution. Check the `/usr/lib` directory for the following libraries:

- `libimgdnn.so`
- `libnnasession.so`
- `libimgdnn_execute.so`

These libraries are pre-installed in RevyOS and generally do not require manual installation.
:::

### NPU Device Permission Configuration

After loading the NPU driver, the device `/dev/vha0` may require permission adjustment for user access. For convenience, set the device permission to 0666 (read/write for all users):

```shell-session
$ sudo chmod 0666 /dev/vha0 # Set device permission to 0666
```

For security, it is recommended to configure `udev` rules for device management. Consult AI or documentation for `udev` configuration.

## x86 Machine Setup

Unlike the [original Yuque documentation](https://www.yuque.com/za4k4z/yp3bry/tx9hcuw35s9x24po#rVPRY), this guide uses a pre-built Docker image for installation. Please ensure Docker is installed on your computer.

### Obtaining and Running the HHB Image

```shell-session
$ docker pull hhb4tools/hhb:2.6.17 # Pull the HHB image
$ docker run --rm -it hhb4tools/hhb:2.6.17 bash # Start a temporary HHB container
```

:::warning[HHB Image Size]
The HHB image is large (~7GB). Downloading may take some time. Please ensure sufficient disk space.
:::

After running the above commands, the container will start and you can operate within it.

:::warning[Container Filesystem]
The container filesystem is temporary. All files created inside the container will be deleted upon exit. It is recommended to copy generated files to the host or use a persistent container.

For more information, refer to the [Docker Official Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) or consult AI.
