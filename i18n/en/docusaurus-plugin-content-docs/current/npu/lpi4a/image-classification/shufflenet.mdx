# ShuffleNet

This tutorial provides guidance on running the ShuffleShuffleNetnet model on RevyOS using the CPU. ShuffleNet is a lightweight convolutional neural network specifically designed for resource-constrained scenarios such as mobile and embedded devices.

:::info[Initial Environment Setup]
Before proceeding, please ensure you have completed the [environment setup](../../env) section.
:::

## Obtaining Example Code

The example code for this tutorial is available on [Github](https://github.com/zhangwm-pt/lpi4a-example). Clone it locally using the following command:

```shell-session
$ git clone https://github.com/zhangwm-pt/lpi4a-example.git
```

The relevant code for this tutorial is located in the `classification/shufflenet` directory.

## Obtaining the Model

The model used in this tutorial is from the [ONNX Model Zoo](https://github.com/onnx/models/blob/main/validated/vision/classification/shufflenet/model/shufflenet-9.onnx). Download the Shufflenet model with the following command:

```shell-session
$ curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onnx/models/main/validated/vision/classification/shufflenet/model/shufflenet-9.onnx
```

:::note[About Github Network Proxy]
If you encounter network issues accessing GitHub from mainland China, consider using a network proxy tool to accelerate access.

### Model Information

| input name      | output name         | input shape      | layout | channel order | scale value | mean values    |
|-----------------|--------------------|------------------|--------|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| gpu_0/data_0    | gpu_0/softmax_1    | 1, 3, 224, 224   | NCHW   | RGB          | 0.017       | 124, 117, 104 |

## Model Conversion and Compilation

On an x86 machine, use the HHB tool to convert the ONNX model into a computation graph and glue code suitable for RevyOS. Before proceeding, ensure you have started the HHB container and cloned the example repository as described in the [environment setup](../../env) section.

### Model Conversion with HHB

In this step, the `onnx` model is converted into a format compatible with the HHB platform.

Navigate to the `classification/shufflenet` directory and execute the following command:

```shell-session
$ hhb -D --model-file ./shufflenet-9.onnx \
    --data-scale 0.017 --data-mean "124 117 104"  \
    --board c920  --postprocess save_and_top5 \
    --input-name "gpu_0/data_0" --output-name "gpu_0/softmax_1" \
    --input-shape "1 3 224 224" --quantization-scheme float16
```

:::info[HHB Parameter Description]
- `-D`: Specifies the HHB process to stop at the executable generation stage
- `--model-file`: Specifies the input model file
- `--data-mean`: Specifies the mean values
- `--data-scale`: Specifies the scale value
- `--board`: Target platform, C920 (CPU) or TH1520 (NPU)
- `--input-name`: Model input tensor name
- `--output-name`: Model output tensor name
- `--input-shape`: Model input tensor shape
- `--postprocess`: Specifies the post-processing behavior for the generated glue code. `save_and_top5` saves the output and prints the top 5 results
- `--quantization-scheme`: Specifies the quantization type as float16

You can run `hhb --help` to view all available parameters and options.
:::

:::info[About HHB Generated Files]
After execution, an `hhb_out` subdirectory will be generated in the current directory, containing files such as `hhb_runtime`, `model.c`, and others:

- `hhb.bm`: HHB model file, including quantized weights and related data
- `hhb_runtime`: Executable for the development board, compiled from the C files in the directory
- `main.c`: Reference entry for the generated example program
- `model.c`: Model structure representation file
- `model.params`: Model weights file
- `io.c`: Example program with file I/O helper functions
- `io.h`: Declarations for I/O helper functions
- `process.c`: Example program with image preprocessing functions
- `process.h`: Declarations for preprocessing functions

For more details on HHB options, refer to the HHB User Manual.
:::

### Compiling the Application

The glue code generated by HHB only tests the model's functionality. For complete image preprocessing and postprocessing, an application using OpenCV is provided to load the model and perform inference.

In the `classification/shufflenet` directory, compile the application with:

```shell-session
$ export OPENCV_DIR=../../modules/opencv/ # Set the path to OpenCV
$ riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-g++ main.cpp -I${OPENCV_DIR}/include/opencv4 -L${OPENCV_DIR}/lib   \
    -lopencv_imgproc   -lopencv_imgcodecs -L${OPENCV_DIR}/lib/opencv4/3rdparty/ \
    -llibjpeg-turbo -llibwebp -llibpng -llibtiff -llibopenjp2    -lopencv_core -ldl  \
    -lpthread -lrt -lzlib -lcsi_cv -latomic -static -o shufflenet_example
```

:::info[About OpenCV]
The example code uses OpenCV for model input preprocessing. Please ensure OpenCV is installed as described in the [environment setup](../../env) section.
:::

:::info[Compilation Parameter Description]
- -I../prebuilt_opencv/include/opencv4: Header file search path, pointing to the OpenCV headers
- -L../prebuilt_opencv/lib: Library search path, pointing to the precompiled OpenCV binaries
- -lopencv_imgproc -lopencv_imgcodecs -lopencv_core: OpenCV libraries
- -llibjpeg-turbo -llibwebp -llibpng -llibtiff -llibopenjp2 -lcsi_cv: OpenCV dependencies
- -static: Static linking
- -o shufflenet_example: Output executable name

After successful compilation, the `shufflenet_example` file will be generated in the example directory.
:::

## Uploading and Running the Application

### Upload to the Development Board

Package all files in this directory and upload them to the development board. For example, use the `scp` command to upload to `/home/debian/npu`:

```shell-session
$ scp -r ../shufflenet/ debian@<board_ip>:/home/debian/shufflenet/
```

Alternatively, you may use other methods such as USB storage devices or network sharing.

### Running the Program

On the development board, navigate to `/home/debian/shufflenet`. Ensure the SHL library is installed and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is configured. Then run:

```shell-session
$ ./shufflenet_example
```

:::info[hhb_runtime Error]
If you encounter the following error:

```shell-session
hhb_out/hhb_runtime: error while loading shared libraries: libshl_th1520.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

Ensure `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is correctly set. If the issue persists, run `pip show shl-python` to check the version.

If the version is `3.x.x`, it is too high. The program requires `shl-python` version 2.x. Downgrade with:

```shell-session
$ pip install shl-python==2.6.17
```
:::

:::info[About NPU Device Permissions]
If you encounter the following error:

```shell-session
FATAL: could not open driver '/dev/vha0': Permission denied
```

Check if the current user has read/write permissions for `/dev/vha0`. Set permissions with:

```shell-session
$ sudo chmod 0666 /dev/vha0
```

It is recommended to configure `udev` rules for automatic permission setting. Consult AI or documentation for `udev` configuration.
:::

:::info[About Long NPU Inference Time]
In theory, the program should run quickly. However, the first run may take over 5 minutes due to JIT compilation when loading the model on the NPU. Due to HHB runtime design, JIT compilation occurs on every run, resulting in long execution times.

For more details, refer to [Common Issues and Solutions](../../issues#npu-推理运行时间过长).
