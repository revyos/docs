# ResNet50

This tutorial guides you through running the ResNet50 model on RevyOS using either the CPU or NPU. ResNet50 is a widely used convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, commonly applied to image classification tasks.

:::info[Initial Environment Setup]
Before proceeding, please ensure you have completed the [environment setup](../../env) section.
:::

## Obtaining Example Code

The example code for this tutorial is available on [Github](https://github.com/zhangwm-pt/lpi4a-example). Clone it locally using the `git` command:

```shell-session
$ git clone https://github.com/zhangwm-pt/lpi4a-example.git
```

The relevant code for this tutorial is located in the `classification/resnet50` directory.

## Obtaining the Model

The model used in this tutorial is from the [ONNX Model Zoo](https://github.com/onnx/models/blob/main/validated/vision/classification/resnet/model/resnet50-v1-7.onnx). Download the ResNet50 model with the following command:

```shell-session
$ curl -OL https://github.com/onnx/models/raw/refs/heads/main/validated/vision/classification/resnet/model/resnet50-v1-7.onnx
```

:::note[About Github Network Proxy]
If you encounter network issues accessing GitHub from mainland China, consider using a network proxy tool to accelerate access.

### Model Information

| GFLOPs | params | accuracy | input name | output name | shape | layout | channel order | scale values | mean values |
| -------- | -------- | ---------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------- | -------- | ---------------- | ---------------| --------------- |
| 8.2    | 25M    | top1 74.9%, top5 92.3% | data       | resnetv17_dense0_fwd | 1, 3, 224, 224 | NCHW   | RGB | 0.017         | 124, 117, 104 |

## Model Conversion and Compilation

On an x86 machine, use the HHB tool to convert the ONNX model into a computation graph and glue code suitable for RevyOS. Before proceeding, ensure you have started the HHB container and cloned the example repository as described in the [environment setup](../../env) section.

:::info[Quick Build Scripts]
To simplify the process, you may use the `cpu_build.sh` and `npu_build.sh` scripts in the directory for automated model conversion and compilation. For custom parameters, refer to the manual steps below.
:::

### Model Conversion with HHB

In this step, the `onnx` model is converted into a format compatible with the HHB platform.

Navigate to the `classification/resnet50` directory and execute the following commands:

<Tabs
  groupId='npu-version'
  defaultValue="npu"
  values={[
    {label: 'NPU', value: 'npu'},
    {label: 'CPU', value: 'cpu'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="cpu">
```shell-session
$ hhb -D --model-file resnet50-v1-7.onnx \
    --data-scale 0.017 --data-mean "124 117 104"  \
    --board c920  --postprocess save_and_top5 \
    --input-name "data" --output-name "resnetv17_dense0_fwd" \
    --input-shape "1 3 224 224" --calibrate-dataset persian_cat.jpg\
     --quantization-scheme float16
```
</TabItem>
    <TabItem value="npu">
```shell-session
$ hhb -D --model-file resnet50-v1-7.onnx \
    --data-scale 0.017 --data-mean "124 117 104"  \
    --board th1520  --postprocess save_and_top5 \
    --input-name "data" --output-name "resnetv17_dense0_fwd" \
    --input-shape "1 3 224 224" --calibrate-dataset persian_cat.jpg  \
    --quantization-scheme "int8_asym"
```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info[About Parameters]
- `-D`: Specifies the HHB process to stop at the executable generation stage
- `--model-file`: Specifies the input model file
- `--data-mean`: Specifies the mean values
- `--data-scale`: Specifies the scale value
- `--board`: Target platform, C920 (CPU) or TH1520 (NPU)
- `--input-name`: Model input tensor name
- `--output-name`: Model output tensor name
- `--input-shape`: Model input tensor shape
- `--postprocess`: Specifies the post-processing behavior for the generated glue code. `save_and_top5` saves the output and prints the top 5 results
- `--quantization-scheme`: Specifies the quantization type

For all available parameters and options, run `hhb --help`.
:::

:::info[About HHB Generated Files]
After execution, a `hhb_out` subdirectory will be generated, containing files such as `hhb_runtime`, `model.c`, and others:

- `hhb.bm`: HHB model file, including quantized weights and related data
- `hhb_runtime`: Executable for the development board, compiled from the C files in the directory
- `main.c`: Reference entry for the generated example program
- `model.c`: Model structure representation file
- `model.params`: Model weights file
- `io.c`: Example program with file I/O helper functions
- `io.h`: Declarations for I/O helper functions
- `process.c`: Example program with image preprocessing functions
- `process.h`: Declarations for preprocessing functions
:::

### Compiling the Application

The glue code generated by HHB only tests the model's functionality. For complete image preprocessing and postprocessing, an application using OpenCV is provided to load the model and perform inference.

In the `classification/resnet50` directory, compile the application with:

```shell-session
$ export OPENCV_DIR=../../modules/opencv/ # Set the path to OpenCV
$ riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-g++ main.cpp -I${OPENCV_DIR}/include/opencv4 -L${OPENCV_DIR}/lib \
    -lopencv_imgproc   -lopencv_imgcodecs -L${OPENCV_DIR}/lib/opencv4/3rdparty/ \
    -llibjpeg-turbo -llibwebp -llibpng -llibtiff -llibopenjp2 \
    -lopencv_core -ldl  -lpthread -lrt -lzlib -lcsi_cv -latomic -static \
    -o resnet50_example # Compile the program
```

:::info[About OpenCV]
The example code uses OpenCV for model input preprocessing. Please ensure OpenCV is installed as described in the [environment setup](../../env) section.
:::

## Uploading and Running the Application

### Upload to the Development Board

Package all files in this directory and upload them to the development board. For example, use `scp` to upload to `/home/debian/npu`:

```shell-session
$ scp -r ../resnet50/ debian@<board_ip>:/home/debian/resnet50/
```

Alternatively, use a USB storage device or network sharing.

### Running the Program

On the development board, navigate to `/home/debian/resnet50`. Ensure the SHL library is installed and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is configured. Then run:

```shell-session
$ ./resnet50_example
```

:::info[hhb_runtime Error]
If you encounter the following error:

```shell-session
hhb_out/hhb_runtime: error while loading shared libraries: libshl_th1520.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

Ensure `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is correctly set. If the issue persists, run `pip show shl-python` to check the version.

If the version is `3.x.x`, it is too high. The Resnet50 program requires `shl-python` version 2.x. Downgrade with:

```shell-session
$ pip install shl-python==2.6.17
```
:::

:::info[About NPU Device Permissions]
If you encounter the following error:

```shell-session
FATAL: could not open driver '/dev/vha0': Permission denied
```

Check if the current user has read/write permissions for `/dev/vha0`. Set permissions with:

```shell-session
$ sudo chmod 0666 /dev/vha0
```

It is recommended to configure `udev` rules for automatic permission setting. Consult AI or documentation for `udev` configuration.
:::

:::info[About Long NPU Inference Time]
In theory, the program should run quickly. However, the first run may take over 5 minutes due to JIT compilation when loading the model on the NPU. Due to HHB runtime design, JIT compilation occurs on every run, resulting in long execution times.

For more details, refer to [Common Issues and Solutions](../../issues#excessive-npu-inference-time).

### Sample output:

In this tutorial, the input is a picture of a Persian cat. The expected result for ResNet50 is that the largest value is at index 283, corresponding to `Persian cat`.
