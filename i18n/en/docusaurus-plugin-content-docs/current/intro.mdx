# RevyOS

## Introduction

[RevyOS](https://github.com/orgs/revyos/repositories) is a Debian-based customised distribution developed and maintained by the RevyOS squad of the RuyiSDK team for the XuanTie chip ecosystem.

RevyOS is part of [RuyiSDK](https://ruyisdk.org/), an open-source project initiated by [PLCT Lab](https://plctlab.org/zh/). The goal of RuyiSDK is to provide a convenient and comprehensive development environment for RISC-V developers. It delivers up-to-date hardware information and software support, including details on supported devices as well as software components such as images (e.g. RevyOS), toolchains, and package managers.

__RevyOS__ offers comprehensive adaptation and optimisation for XuanTie C906, C910, C920, C908 and other processors. It ships with a GCC toolchain that supports the XuanTie extension instruction set and RVV 1.0 by default, together with Glibc and the kernel that are tuned for RVV 1.0.

At present, __RevyOS__ already satisfies day-to-day needs in office work, web browsing, and video playback.

Thanks to these customisations and optimisations, __RevyOS__ delivers excellent performance and user experience on hardware platforms such as Milk-V Meles and Lichee Pi 4A.
