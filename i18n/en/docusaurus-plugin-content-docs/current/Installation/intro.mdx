# Image Flashing Notes

RevyOS currently supports multiple devices. The table below summarises which flashing guides are available for each device; follow the link that matches your needs. Some guides are still being compiled and will be added later.

:::warning
**If you are upgrading from an image dated `20240720` or earlier, you must reset the U-Boot environment variables.**

To reset:
Connect to the board via the serial console, power it on, press Enter when U-Boot starts to interrupt the boot sequence, and run the following commands at the U-Boot prompt:

```bash
env default -a -f; env save; reset
```

This resets all U-Boot environment variables and reboots the board.
