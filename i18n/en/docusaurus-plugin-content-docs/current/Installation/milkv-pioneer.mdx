# Installing RevyOS on the Milk-V Pioneer

## Preparation

### Required Tools

- microSD card
- microSD card reader
- NVMe SSD adaptor

### Downloading the Image

RevyOS image directory: [Download Link](https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/revyos/extra/images/sg2042/)

Latest image version: {<DownloadLink device="Milk-V Pioneer" />}

Example directory for the 20241230 image:

![Image Directory](/img/image-for-flash/pioneer-image-dir.png)

RevyOS requires flashing both firmware and system files, as listed below.

There are two separate firmware, one include `zsbl`, `linuxboot`, device trees and more, which handles the system boot process.

This part of firmware can be flashed to either the SPI Flash or microSD card:

- **Firmware files**:
  - `firmware_single_sg2042-v6.6-lts-v0p7.bin` (for SPI Flash)
  - `firmware_single_sg2042-v6.6-lts-v0p7.img` (for SD card)

The other part is the MCU firmware. Newer versions of MCU firmware has fixed some known issues, an upgrade is recommended, after completing the system installation.

And also the system image itself which needs to be flashed to M.2 NVMe SSD:

- `revyos-pioneer-20241230-212249.img.zst`

## Flashing the Firmware

### Flashing Firmware to SD Card

**Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04

#### Using BalenaEtcher

1. Select the file `firmware_single_sg2042-v6.6-lts-v0p7.img`.
2. Choose the target SD card.
3. Click "Flash" to start the process.

#### Using Command Line

Insert the SD card into a reader connected to your computer, then verify the device path.

Navigate to the directory with `firmware_single_sg2042-v6.6-lts-v0p7.img` and flash it with the following command:

```shell
sudo dd if=firmware_single_sg2042-v6.6-lts-v0p7.img of=/dev/sda bs=4M status=progress
```

Replace `of=/dev/sda` with your specific device path if different.

After flashing, use `sync` to ensure data is fully written to the SD card.

### Flashing Firmware to SPI Flash

**Operating System**: RevyOS 20241230

> **Note**: For first-time installation, using an SD card to store the firmware is recommended.

#### Using Command Line

Flashing to the SPI Flash requires installing utilities and loading the `mtd` module.

Install necessary packages:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install mtd-utils
   sudo modprobe mtdblock
   ```

Download the firmware file:

   ```bash
   wget https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/revyos/extra/images/sg2042/20241230/firmware_single_sg2042-v6.6-lts-v0p7.bin
   ```

Navigate to the directory where `firmware_single_sg2042-v6.6-lts-v0p7.bin` was downloaded and run:

   ```bash
   sudo flashcp -v firmware_single_sg2042-v6.6-lts-v0p7.bin /dev/mtd1
   ```

Flashing to SPI Flash is now complete.

## 3. Flashing the RevyOS Image

**Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04

### Using Command Line

1. Decompress the `revyos-pioneer-20241230-212249.img.zst` file using `unzstd revyos-pioneer-20241230-212249.img.zst`. This produces the `revyos-pioneer-20241230-212249.img` file.

2. Insert the NVMe SSD into the reader and connect it to your computer, then confirm the device path.

3. In the directory containing `revyos-pioneer-20241230-212249.img`, flash the image to the NVMe SSD with dd command: `sudo dd if=revyos-pioneer-20241230-212249.img of=/dev/nvme0n1 bs=4M status=progress`. Replace `of=/dev/nvme0n1` with the correct device path if different.

4. After flashing, use `sync` to ensure the data is fully written to the NVMe SSD.

## MCU Firmware upgrade

After you finished system installation process and successfully booted into the system, open up a terminal or connect via SSH.

First, install `wget`, download the MCU firmware and `mcu-util`.

```shell
sudo apt update; sudo apt install -y wget
mkdir mcu && cd mcu
wget https://github.com/sophgo/mcu/releases/download/2025.01.20/mcu-util-riscv64
# Use the file below for Milk-V Pioneer; for other boards please choose accordingly at the GitHub Release page.
wget https://github.com/sophgo/mcu/releases/download/2025.01.20/sg2042evb-mcu-v8-2025-01-20-10-21-22.bin
```

Then load `i2c-dev` kernel module and start flashing:

```shell
sudo modprobe i2c-dev
chmod +x mcu-util-riscv64
sudo ./mcu-util-riscv64 upgrade-full 1 0x17 sg2042evb-mcu-v8-2025-01-20-10-21-22.bin
```

If everything goes fine then you should get log like this:

```log
erase page 0000e000
program flash 00010000 100%
read flash 00010000 100%
verify flash data ok
```

After finishing the flashing process, please power off the board and cut off the AC power entirely.

It is recommended to wait for around 1~5 minutes before plugging in and power on the board.
