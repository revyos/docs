:::warning
Before following the instructions, **compare your board with the reference image below**. Proceed only after confirming that the hardware matches.

![Lichee Pi 4A reference](/img/image-for-flash/lpi4a.png)
:::

## Demonstration Environment

All steps in this tutorial were validated in the following environment:

- Operating system: Windows 11 24H2 (OS build 26100.3194)
- Architecture: x86_64
- Lichee Pi 4A configuration: 16 GB RAM + 128 GB eMMC

:::note
Every procedure documented here is reproducible in this environment. If you encounter any issues during flashing, please refer to [issue submission](../../issue/).
:::

## Boot Options

Lichee Pi 4A supports two boot modes: [boot from an SD card](#boot-from-sd-card) and [boot from eMMC](#boot-from-emmc). Select the mode that fits your scenario.

:::warning
Flashing an image erases all existing data. **Back up important information before you start.**
:::

## Boot from SD Card

:::warning
**DIP switch reminder**

Booting from SD card does not require changing the DIP switch; keep it in the eMMC position.

![DIP switch reference](/img/image-for-flash/Switch.png)

The DIP switch is located on the underside of the board and becomes visible after removing the core board. Both toggles should point downward.

**Note:** Early revisions of the Lichee Pi 4A board may not include a DIP switch.
:::

:::warning
**SD card compatibility**

Some SD cards may not work reliably. Check the [Lichee Pi 4A SD card compatibility list](../../miscellaneous/lpi4a-sdcard-list/) to confirm whether your card has known issues.
:::

### Preparation

:::warning
**Upgrading from images dated `20240720` or earlier requires resetting the U-Boot environment variables.**

Reset procedure:
Connect to the board over the serial console, power it on, interrupt U-Boot by pressing Enter, and run:

```bash
env default -a -f; env save; reset
```

This restores all U-Boot environment variables and reboots the board.
:::

#### Obtain the SD Card Image

Download the Lichee Pi 4A system image that starts with `sdcard-` from the following locations:

- [RevyOS 20240720 (Kernel 5.10)](https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/revyos/extra/images/lpi4a/20240720/)
- Latest release (Kernel 6.6): {<DownloadLink device="Lichee Pi 4A" />}

:::note
**About kernel versions**

The 20240720 image uses Kernel 5.10, which is stable for multimedia and general workloads.

The latest image uses Kernel 6.6. It may still contain unresolved issuesâ€”video stutter and USB power loss have been observed and are being fixed.
:::

The example below uses the 20250123 image.

Two download methods are available:

- **Browser download:** click the link to start downloading.

![Browser download](/img/image-for-flash/web-download-windows.png)

- **Command-line download:** open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
curl.exe -OL https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/revyos/extra/images/lpi4a/20250123/sdcard-lpi4a-20250123_195216.img.zst
```

:::note
`curl.exe` [has shipped with Windows since Windows 10](https://curl.se/windows/microsoft.html). If it is unavailable, use the browser download method instead.
:::

Wait until the progress reaches 100%; the download then completes.

![Command-line download](/img/image-for-flash/download-image-command-line-windows.png)

Regardless of the method, the result is the compressed archive `sdcard-lpi4a-20250123_195216.img.zst`. Because transmission errors can occur, verifying the download with a checksum is recommended.

#### Verify the Image (Optional but Recommended)

Open File Explorer, navigate to the folder containing the image, right-click, and choose **Open in Terminal**.

![Open in Terminal](/img/image-for-flash/context_menu_terminal_open_windows.png)

In the PowerShell window, fetch the reference checksums from the mirror:

```powershell
curl.exe -L https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/revyos/extra/images/lpi4a/20250123/md5sum.txt
```

Then compute the checksum for the local file:

```powershell
Get-FileHash -Algorithm MD5 .\sdcard-lpi4a-20250123_195216.img.zst
```

![Checksum verification](/img/image-for-flash/checksum-verification-image.png)

Compare the two values. If they differ, re-download the image.

#### Extract the Image

The image is compressed with `zstd`. Use an archive tool that supports `.zst`, such as [PeaZip](https://peazip.github.io/) or [7-Zip (Zstd build)](https://github.com/mcmilk/7-Zip-zstd).

![Extract with PeaZip](/img/image-for-flash/peazip_extraction_illustration.png)

:::warning
**Extraction size reminder**

The extracted file is about **10.2 GB**. Ensure sufficient disk space before unpacking.
:::

#### Hardware Preparation

Prepare a MicroSD card reader and a MicroSD card. Because of compatibility concerns, consult the [tested card list](https://github.com/revyos/revyos/blob/main/Installation/card%20list.md).

:::note
If your card is not on the list and you experience flashing or boot failures, submit an issue via [this page](../../issue/) and consider using the [eMMC flashing method](#boot-from-emmc) instead.
:::

#### Write the Image with BalenaEtcher

Download BalenaEtcher from [https://etcher.balena.io/](https://etcher.balena.io/). Select [Etcher for Windows](https://github.com/balena-io/etcher/releases/download/v1.19.25/balenaEtcher-1.19.25.Setup.exe) and install it.

![BalenaEtcher version selection](/img/image-for-flash/balenaetcher-version-selection.png)

1. Insert the SD card into the reader and connect it to the PC.
2. Launch BalenaEtcher.
3. Click **Flash from file** and choose the image.
4. Select the target device.
5. Click **Flash** to start writing.
6. Wait for the success message.

![BalenaEtcher flashing flow](/img/image-for-flash/balenaetcher-flashing-guide.png)

:::warning
**Safe removal reminder**

Before removing the SD card, ensure BalenaEtcher reports completion, the SD card LED has stopped blinking, and eject the card via the system tray. Otherwise, the card or data may be corrupted.
:::

### Boot the System via SD Card

After flashing, insert the SD card into the slot shown below.
![](/img/image-for-flash/lpi4a5.png)

Connect an HDMI cable if a monitor is required. Use the supplied USB-A-to-USB-C cable: plug the USB-C end into the board and the USB-A end into a power source that can supply at least 5 V / 2 A to power on the system.

## Boot from eMMC

You can flash the eMMC image with or without a serial cable. Because a serial cable is optional, the default workflow below assumes no serial connection. If you plan to use a serial console, refer to the relevant sections in the [Linux flashing guide](./licheepi4a.mdx).

:::warning
Remove the SD card before booting from eMMC.
:::

### Preparation

:::warning
**Upgrading from images dated `20240720` or earlier requires resetting the U-Boot environment variables.**

Reset procedure:
Connect to the board via serial, power it on, interrupt U-Boot, and run:

```bash
env default -a -f; env save; reset
```

This restores all U-Boot environment variables and reboots the board.
:::

#### Install the Flashing Tools

Flashing eMMC requires writing the `u-boot`, `boot`, and `root` images with `fastboot`. Determine whether `fastboot.exe` is installed. If it is missing or older than version 34, install the latest Platform Tools:

```powershell
winget install google.platformtools
```

(Older `fastboot` releases fail when flashing recent images.)

Open PowerShell in the folder containing `fastboot.exe` and verify it runs:

```powershell
.\fastboot.exe --version
```

![Fastboot tool detection](/img/image-for-flash/fastboot_tool_detection.png)

A version string indicates that `fastboot` is ready.

#### Obtain the Images

Download the Lichee Pi 4A system images from:

- [RevyOS 20240720 (Kernel 5.10)](https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/revyos/extra/images/lpi4a/20240720/)
- Latest release (Kernel 6.6): {<DownloadLink device="Lichee Pi 4A" />}

:::note
**About kernel versions**

The 20240720 image (Kernel 5.10) is stable for multimedia workloads.

The latest image (Kernel 6.6) may still expose issues such as video stutter or USB power loss; fixes are underway.
:::

:::warning
**Selecting the correct U-Boot image**

Different memory configurations require different U-Boot binaries. Match your core board to the table below:

| Memory and storage | U-Boot image |
| --- | --- |
| 8 GB RAM + 8 GB eMMC | u-boot-with-spl-lpi4a-main_8gemmc.bin |
| 8 GB RAM + 32 GB eMMC | u-boot-with-spl-lpi4a-main.bin |
| 16 GB RAM | u-boot-with-spl-lpi4a-16g-main.bin |

If you cannot confirm the configuration, scan the QR code sticker on the core board. Each shipped board includes stickers on both the core and base boards. Scanning the core board sticker reveals the RAM and storage combination.

Example for a 16 GB RAM + 128 GB eMMC board:

![core-card](/img/image-for-flash/core-card.png)

The scanned result looks like this:

![Core board-info](/img/image-for-flash/card-info.png)

The second line specifies the RAM plus storage configuration.
:::

After identifying the correct build, download, verify, and extract the `uboot`, `boot`, and `root` images (the U-Boot binary does not require extraction) as described in the SD card section.

![Downloaded images](/img/image-for-flash/downloaded_image.png)

#### Connect the Board and Install Drivers

Press and hold the BOOT button, then connect the Type-C port nearest the BOOT button to the PC. The board enters flashing mode.

Open **Device Manager**. If you see `USB download gadget` under **Other devices**, the device is detected but lacks a driver.

Download the [Google USB Driver](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/usb_driver_r13-windows.zip) (a proxy may be required), extract it, and install it:

1. Right-click `USB download gadget` and choose **Update driver**.
2. Select **Browse my computer for drivers**.
![Driver update step 2](/img/image-for-flash/driver-update-step2.png)
3. Choose **Let me pick from a list of available drivers on my computer**.
4. Select **Show All Devices**, then click **Next**.
![Driver update step 4](/img/image-for-flash/driver-update-step-4.png)
5. Click **Have Disk**.
6. Click **Browse**, select the `.inf` file inside the Google USB Driver folder, and confirm.
![Driver update step 6](/img/image-for-flash/driver-update-step-6.png)
7. Choose **Android Bootloader Interface**, click **Next**, approve the prompts, and select **Install** when Windows Security asks for confirmation.
![Driver update step 7](/img/image-for-flash/driver-update-step7.png)
8. The fastboot driver finishes installing.
![Driver update step 8](/img/image-for-flash/driver_update_step8.png)

If installation fails, uninstall the device from Device Manager, reconnect the board, and repeat the steps.

### Flash the Images

Back in the PowerShell window that contains `fastboot.exe`, verify the device connection:

```powershell
.\fastboot.exe devices
```

![Fastboot device detection](/img/image-for-flash/fastboot_device_detection.png)

Flash a temporary U-Boot to RAM and reboot:

```powershell
.\fastboot.exe flash ram .\u-boot-with-spl-lpi4a-16g.bin # Replace with the path to the U-Boot image for your configuration
.\fastboot.exe reboot
```

![Flash U-Boot to RAM](/img/image-for-flash/uboot_memory_flash.png)

After the board restarts, Windows may again report an unknown `USB download gadget`. Install the driver once more if needed.

Then flash the persistent images (drag-and-drop files into PowerShell to insert their paths quickly):

```powershell
.\fastboot.exe flash uboot u-boot-with-spl-lpi4a-16g.bin
.\fastboot.exe flash boot boot-lpi4a-20240720_171951.ext4
.\fastboot.exe flash root root-lpi4a-20240720_171951.ext4
```

![Fastboot flashing](/img/image-for-flash/fastboot_installation_guide.png)

:::warning
**Progress and timing note**

Flashing `uboot` and `boot` completes quickly. Writing `root` takes roughly five minutes. If `fastboot` shows an unusually small number of data blocks (e.g. only a few thousand), the earlier steps likely failedâ€”repeat the flashing procedure.

![Incorrect fastboot flashing](/img/image-for-flash/bad-fastboot-flash.png)
:::

Once flashing finishes, power-cycle the board to boot from eMMC.

## User Credentials

Default login credentials:

- Username: `debian`
- Password: `debian`

Use these for the first boot and change the password immediately for security.
