## Booting from SD Card

> **Note:** Ensure the dip switch is set for eMMC boot, even when booting from an SD card.

### Preparation

#### Hardware

- A MicroSD card reader

#### Required Tools

Download the [BalenaEtcher tool](https://etcher.balena.io/) for flashing.
Install `zstd` for decompressing the image:

```bash
apt install zstd
```

#### Downloading the Image

Download the system image for LicheePi4A from the [RevyOS mirror site](https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/revyos/extra/images/lpi4a/20240720/).

Decompress the downloaded image file:

```bash
unzstd sdcard-lpi4a-20240720_171951.img.zst
```

### Writing the Image to the MicroSD Card

1. Insert the SD card into the reader and connect it to the computer.
2. Open BalenaEtcher, click "Flash from file," and select the `.img` file.

## Booting from eMMC

When booting from eMMC, RevyOS images are flashed to the eMMC storage using `fastboot`. There are two options: connecting with or without a serial interface. This guide provides instructions for both methods.

### Preparation

Flashing the image to eMMC requires U-Boot, boot, and root files to be flashed via `fastboot`. Ensure `fastboot` is installed:

```bash
apt install fastboot
```

If using a serial connection, install `minicom` to monitor the console:

```bash
apt install minicom
```

#### Downloading the Image

Download the necessary image files for LicheePi4A from the [RevyOS mirror site](https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/revyos/extra/images/lpi4a/20240720/). 

Make sure to choose the U-Boot file that matches your board model (8GB or 16GB).

### Flashing the Image to eMMC (Without Serial Connection)

1. Hold down the reset button on the board and connect it to the computer via USB. The board will enter flashing mode.

### Flashing the Image to eMMC (With Serial Connection)

1. Open `minicom` in a terminal to access the serial console:

   ```bash
   sudo minicom
   ```

2. Connect the USB end to the computer, and connect the Type-C interface on the board to the computer with a USB-Type-C cable.

3. In the serial console, press any key to interrupt the boot process. Then, enter the following command:

   ```bash
   fastboot usb 0
   ```

4. In a new terminal window, navigate to the folder where the image files are stored, and execute the following flash commands:

   ```bash
   fastboot flash uboot u-boot-with-spl-lpi4a-16g.bin
   fastboot flash boot boot-lpi4a-20240720_171951.ext4
   fastboot flash root root-lpi4a-20240720_171951.ext4
   ```

5. Monitor the flashing progress in the serial console.

6. After flashing is complete, disconnect the USB-Type-C cable, connect the power cable, and boot into the system.
